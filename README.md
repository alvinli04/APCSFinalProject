## Stephen's Sausage Squad

Alvin Li and Andrew Juang

Project Description:

We will be implementing a 2D version of the tile-based puzzle game Stephen’s Sausage Roll from a bird’s eye view. It’s an orientation-based puzzle game where the player controlled character pushes sausages with their fork to designated grilling spots for, well, grilling. But if the sausage becomes overcooked or falls off the map, the level must be restarted. There are obstacles on each level, and the player must orient themselves and the sausages correctly to cook the sausages and clear the level.
