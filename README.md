## Stephen's Sausage Squad

Alvin Li and Andrew Juang

Project Description:

We will be implementing a 2D version of the tile-based puzzle game Stephen’s Sausage Roll from a bird’s eye view. It’s an orientation-based puzzle game where the player controlled character pushes sausages with their fork to designated grilling spots for, well, grilling. But if the sausage becomes overcooked or falls off the map, the level must be restarted. There are obstacles on each level, and the player must orient themselves and the sausages correctly to cook the sausages and clear the level.

5/23 (Alvin) - wrote the skeleton for classes and their methods, implemented the basic tile structure of the game, as well as WASD movement and rotations. Put in some obstacles which restrict movement and rotations.
5/23 (Andrew) - worked on prototype diagram, the UML diagram, began brainstorming ideas on the implementation of sausage movement. 

5/24 (Alvin/Andrew) - shared screens in zoom meeting, created branch sausagemovement, and began implementing the touchSausage method. updated the sausage class to work with the touchSausage method.
